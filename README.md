USER STORY

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

DESCRIPTION OF TASK

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

EXECUTION OF TASK

I used the Boostrap framework to kick off this assignment. I used Jquery to code the functionality of the day planner. I imported some font using an API. The assignment was not a lot of code, but I had to utilize all that I have learned thus far in the course to create it. I created it exactly as the example so I hope you will like what I did!
It is an in real time planner, that updates hourly. I have color coordinated the planner to show which hours have past, which hour you are on and which hour is next. It is a day planner so I only made it usable from 9 to 5, demonstrating a typical work day. The user can put text and save it using the save button next to the text box. You should be able to relaod the page and still see your plans for the day saved. You must delete the text and press the save button next to the text box in order to remove your words from the planner. 
This is a highly useful website and I enjoyed coding it!
